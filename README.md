# spelling-bee
This is a repository for the program I made to beat the New York Times Spelling Bee game.

The two files in the root directory (spelling-bee.py and spelling-bee-naive.py) are separate implementations of a program used to find words to use in the New York Times Spelling Bee game. The program in spelling-bee.py opens a dictionary and then creates a trie out of the words it finds. It then takes in letters used in the game and uses them to find valid words by following each letter's edge at each node in the trie and recurring. If a given node is "terminal" signaling a complete word, it is printed. The spelling-bee-naive.py program opens a dictionary and iterates through the words, testing each one individually for validity.

The "dictionaries" directory contains a sample dictionary made from a combination of different text dictionaries I found on a Purdue-hosted ftp server. It also has a few words that I've added because they were used in the Spelling Bee game and not found in the dictionaries I pulled from.

The "for-bench" directory contains modified copies of the files found in the root directory designed to work without user input. I made them so that I could benchmark and profile the programs to see which was faster, the naive implementation or the trie-based approach. The sb-profiler.py script runs both programs through python3's cProfiler and prints the output. Also in this folder are HTML output files generated by the CLI tool "bench".
